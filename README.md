### Description
LockIn is a student-focused desktop application designed to make studying more manageable and collaborative. Built with a clean, modern user interface, LockIn allows users to create an account, log in, and connect with others through a real-time chat system powered by a central chat server. Once inside, users can message one another, work through practice questions, stay productive using an integrated Pomodoro timer, as well as many other such features. Whether studying solo or with peers, LockIn creates a supportive virtual environment to help students stay focused and engaged.
